# SummerSchoolProject

This project is a JRPG combat styled game with a main focus in AI development. 
In this project i'm a solo developer.
It's being built using Unreal Engine 5.

As i lack skills in 3D and 2D art and music, most of the visual stuff and music in this game are assets with some of it self made depending on needs., 

//add instructions to deploy/play the game later date

Week 1

What i learned this week. a basic construct of how best start building this type of project.

Week 2

Delved deeply and rebuilt in my "own image" what i learned last week as understanding after that week was pretty bad, 
so i spent this week on learning and trying to understand what was made.

Week 3

Project is going alright, although i backtracked a bit from week 2s thought which slowed down things although i kept the 2nd project that i also built when i'm confused and need to better understanding on different things. Playerside battle base UI has been finished. 

There aren't really any bigger problems at the moment other than time issues.

Learned a bunch and researched about building UI in turn based game in more efficent manner. Also studied and and tried a bunch of thing with event dispatchers as that was completly new to me

Next week i'm not gonna be able to get much done, i'm busy then. i'll get done what i can get done

week 4

I didn't get much done this week as i was really busy, i did however end up doing when i had time bit of smaller work such as adding damage numbers and combat effects i did also start with the magic system.

problems haven't really changed for last week.

goals for next week would be to finish off magic system and maybe get some graphics for enemy and ally

Week 5 

Last weeks goals were achieved magic system base has been finished. Also downloaded 2 asset packs 1 containing multiple enemies and 1 containing 1 ally unit. Gave enemies and 1 ally graphics and animations. Also made death and winning conditions including vicotry scene leveling etc.

Problems in project atm are that leveling don't actually update the player bsae stats, only the level number itself. Not currently in a hurry for fixing this.

Learned more about UI and how to properly make it interact with the game nicely although it tends to be a maze of confusion it tends to be more managable for me atm.

Goals for next week are to add a field mode for game and transition between field and combat mode in game. Also have enemies spawn for certain pool that can be changed depending on area player is located. And hopefully start with the boss and it's AI
