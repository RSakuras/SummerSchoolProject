# SummerSchoolProject

This project is a JRPG combat styled game with a main focus in AI development. 
In this project i'm a solo developer.
It's being built using Unreal Engine 5.

As i lack skills in 3D and 2D art and music, most of the visual stuff and music in this game are assets with some of it self made depending on needs., 

//add instructions to deploy/play the game later date

Week 1
What i learned this week. a basic construct of how best start building this type of project.

Week 2
Delved deeply and rebuilt in my "own image" what i learned last week as understanding after that week was pretty bad, 
so i spent this week on learning and trying to understand what was made.

Week 3 and 4
Learned a bunch and researched about building UI in turn based game in more efficent manner. Also studied and and tried a bunch of thing with event dispatchers as that was completly new to me
