# SummerSchoolProject

This project is a JRPG combat styled game with a main focus in AI development. 
In this project i'm a solo developer.
It's being built using Unreal Engine 5.

As i lack skills in 3D and 2D art and music, most of the visual stuff and music in this game are assets with some of it self made depending on needs.

Music and sound effects obtained from https://www.zapsplat.com

//add instructions to deploy/play the game later date

Week 1

What i learned this week. a basic construct of how best start building this type of project.

Week 2

Delved deeply and rebuilt in my "own image" what i learned last week as understanding after that week was pretty bad, 
so i spent this week on learning and trying to understand what was made.

Week 3

Project is going alright, although i backtracked a bit from week 2s thought which slowed down things although i kept the 2nd project that i also built when i'm confused and need to better understanding on different things. Playerside battle base UI has been finished. 

There aren't really any bigger problems at the moment other than time issues.

Learned a bunch and researched about building UI in turn based game in more efficent manner. Also studied and and tried a bunch of thing with event dispatchers as that was completly new to me

Next week i'm not gonna be able to get much done, i'm busy then. i'll get done what i can get done

week 4

I didn't get much done this week as i was really busy, i did however end up doing when i had time bit of smaller work such as adding damage numbers and combat effects i did also start with the magic system.

problems haven't really changed for last week.

goals for next week would be to finish off magic system and maybe get some graphics for enemy and ally

Week 5 

Last weeks goals were achieved magic system base has been finished. Also downloaded 2 asset packs 1 containing multiple enemies and 1 containing 1 ally unit. Gave enemies and 1 ally graphics and animations. Also made death and winning conditions including vicotry scene leveling etc.

Problems in project atm are that leveling don't actually update the player bsae stats, only the level number itself. Not currently in a hurry for fixing this.

Learned more about UI and how to properly make it interact with the game nicely although it tends to be a maze of confusion it tends to be more managable for me atm.

Goals for next week are to add a field mode for game and transition between field and combat mode in game. Also have enemies spawn for certain pool that can be changed depending on area player is located. And hopefully start with the boss and it's AI

Week 6

Last weeks goals were achieved, There is a nice screenshatter transition between 2 game modes, enemies spawn from certain pool that changes using trigger volume, also boss spawns correctly at it's own specified location with possible adds on it's side if wanted. Also started on boss AI by giving him attack rotation and few custom attacks, also gave him a passive reflect shield.

problem from the last week are still the same, not planning to fix it yet.

Goals for next week would be to maybe download/make a small field map and continue boss design.

Week 7

Last weeks goals were more or less achieved. I've downloaded map, made transition work good. Made enemies spawn properly and nicely, boss encounter also feels a lot nicer fight against as well. Also made player friends in field mode.

unfortunatly i didn't have much time this week to work on project, but i did what i could when i could here and there doing boat loads of small fixes and changes. The type of fixes that you wouldn't know were fixed, but you would notice if they weren't.

problems from last week persist, no plans of fixing that yet.

Goals for next week, main goal would be to create a paradim shift system, it's a idea i'll be "copying" from FFXIII, i really like it so i'm gonna make it. Also in field mode, maybe increase that side a bit and maybe download assets for fwends.
